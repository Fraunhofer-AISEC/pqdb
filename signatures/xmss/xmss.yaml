stateful: true

problems comment: "Only properties of hash functions assumed. This is implicitly assumed by all schemes, so we don't list it explicitly here."
trust comment: "Very high because of minimal assumptions: Only relies on some rather weak properties of the hash function used (collision resistance is only required for the hash function used on the message itself)"
