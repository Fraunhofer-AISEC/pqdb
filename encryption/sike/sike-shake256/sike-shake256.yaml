name: SIKE-SHAKE256
type: KEM
security notion: IND-CCA
dh-ness: Due to the fact that SIKE is based on the Supersingular Isogeny
  Diffie-Hellman (SIDH) problem, the resulting PKE and KEM schemes are modified
  versions of the classical ElGamal scheme and the transformation of Hofheinz,
  HÃ¶velmanns and Kiltz. The security proofs follow immediately by replacing
  the group-based computational Diffie-Hellman problem by its analogue SIDH
  problem.
